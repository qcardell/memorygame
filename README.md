# How to Play the Game
The game board consists of twelve to twenty-four cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of sixteen pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

On each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
