# Memory Game

Project:  Memory Game

Instructions:
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your mastery of JavaScript. 
You’ll build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). 
But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!

This is my version of the memory game using HTML, CSS, and java script.
